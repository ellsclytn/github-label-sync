This would provide a significant reduction to execution time over hitting GitHub APIs for each and every authorised webhook, and would help mitigate potential GitHub API Rate Limiting.\n\nFor this to work, we'd need to be able to build out an initial dataset of labels, which is a potentially quite slow operation (may need to be split across multiple Lambda invocations).","files":null}]}
